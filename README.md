# AI-Puzzle-Solver


## Project Overview
This project implements an **AI-based puzzle solver** for the **8-Puzzle and 15-Puzzle problems** using various **search algorithms and heuristics**. The goal is to explore different Artificial Intelligence search techniques to solve these puzzles efficiently.

The implementation includes fundamental search strategies such as **Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), Uniform-Cost Search (UCS), and A* Search**. Additionally, several heuristics (h1, h2, h3, and h4) have been implemented and tested to evaluate their efficiency in solving the 15-Puzzle.

##  Features Implemented
-  **Puzzle Environment:** Implements both the 8-Puzzle and 15-Puzzle with a flexible codebase.
-  **Search Algorithms:** Includes DFS, BFS, UCS, and A* Search.
- **Heuristic Functions:** Implements four different heuristics:
  - Misplaced Tiles Heuristic (h1)
  - Manhattan Distance (h2)
  - Euclidean Distance (h3)
  - Linear Conflict (h4)
-  **Performance Comparison:** Benchmarks different heuristics and search algorithms based on execution time, expanded nodes, and memory usage.
-  **Automated Testing:** Runs simulations on **1,000 randomly generated 15-Puzzle scenarios** to compare the performance of different search methods.
